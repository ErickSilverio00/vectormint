            "question1": "What is vector art?",
            "answer1": "Vector art is a type of digital graphic that uses mathematical formulas to render images. Unlike bitmap (raster) images, which are made of pixels, vector art uses mathematical paths, meaning it can be scaled infinitely without losing quality.",
            "question2": "What types of images can I vectorize?",
            "answer2": "You can vectorize almost any image, but the best results are obtained with images that have clear lines and well-defined contrasts. Logos, icons, illustrations, and simple drawings work very well. Complex photographs can be vectorized, but the result may be more stylized.",
            "question3": "In what formats can I download my vectorized art?",
            "answer3": "We currently offer downloads in SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format, which is widely compatible with design software such as Adobe Illustrator, Figma, Inkscape, and others. You can also use the SVG directly on websites.",
            "question4": "Is the service really free?",
            "answer4": "Yes! The vectorization service is completely free, with no watermarks or limitations on the downloaded images.",
            "question5": "How can I edit the SVG file after downloading it?",
            "answer5": "You can edit the SVG file in any vector design software like Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW, Inkscape (free), or online tools like Figma. These programs allow you to modify colors, sizes, shapes, and other aspects of your file.",
            "question6": "Are my images stored on your servers?",
            "answer6": "No. All processing is done directly in your browser, locally. Your images are never sent to our servers, ensuring complete privacy and security."
